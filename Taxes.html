        <p>Before diving in headfirst into filing taxes, it's important to familiarize yourself with the vocabulary:</p>
        <div class="subs">
          <p>EARNED INCOME- salaries, wages, tips, taxable scholarships or grants</p>
	        <p>UNEARNED INCOME- investments, interest on savings, unemployment compensation, etc.</p>
          <p>GROSS INCOME- total income in the form of money, goods, property, etc. that is not tax-exempt</p>
	        <p>EXEMPTIONS- a preset amount of money that can be deducted from the taxable amount for basic living expenses. You and any dependents qualify.</p>
	        <p>STANDARD DEDUCTION- money that the government gives you if you qualify. It differs through different marital statuses</p>
          <p>ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS- there are 6 main categories of deductables:</p>
          <p style="margin-left:35px;">Medical/dental, Taxes, Interest, Charity contributions, Casualty loss/theft</p>
	        <p style="margin-left:35px;">These deductions lower the taxes owed.</p>
	        <p>W-2 FORMS- these are wage-income forms from employers. They help prepare for filing taxes.</p>
	        <p>FILING STATUS- single/married/head of household status, with other sub-categories</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect">
        <p>Depending on your income, you may or may not be required to file taxes. In Washington State 2019, if you made less than $12,000 a year, you would most likely not need to file your taxes.</p>
        <p>Your state also determines what you are taxed on. Washington State has a high sales tax, but no income tax. On the other hand, Oregon has no sales tax but does have an income tax.</p>
        <p>There are different forms to file:</p>
        <div class="subs">
          <p>1040EZ- shortest/simplest</p>
	        <p>1040A-longer, has more flexibility</p>
          <p>1040- "long form" for income over $50,000</p>
        </div>
        <br>
