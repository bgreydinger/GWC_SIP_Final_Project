      <p>College is the next big step many take after highschool. For those of you who are college bound and are deciding which university is the right fit for you, tuition cost might be on your mind.</p>
      <p>According to the Institute for College Access and Success, nearly 70% of college students take out a student loan (aka you are not alone). If you yourself are considering financial aid, continue reading to learn the basics on student loans.</p>
      <p>There are two types of loans: Public loans and Private Loans.</p>

      <h4><em>Public Loans:</em></h4>
      <p>Public Loans are provided by the federal government and the interest rates are set by Congress. Interest rates range from 4.45% to 7% and can be subsidized or unsubsidized.</p>
      <div class="subs">
        <p>Direct Subsidized Loans: The interest on the loans do not accrue while the student is still enrolled.  It is available to students who meet the financial need criteria.</p>
        <p>Direct Unsubsidized Loans: These loans are not awarded based on financial need and are available to most students. However, it may not cover your full college tuition.</p>

      <div class="contnt">
      <h4><em>Private Loans:</em></h4>
      <p>Private student loans require the student to pass a credit and income reviewer to ensure to the lender that the student will be able to repay the loan. </p>
