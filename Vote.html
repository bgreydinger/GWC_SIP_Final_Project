        <h4>Why Vote?</h4>
        <p>You've likely heard all the reasons why one should vote: upholding your civic duty, securing our American democracy, and taking a personal stance. This all sounds great. But why vote when your one voice among millions? Does your vote really make an impact? In short, yes.</p>
        <p>But don't just take my word for it. In the 2008 midterms Alaska Republican kept his seat to the state legislature by beating Democrat Karl Kassel by just one vote. Similarly, in 2014 Republican candidate James M. Kelcourse defeated Democrat Edward C. Cameron for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives by a margin of just 10 votes. </p>
        <p>Even outside of midterm elections which have direct elections without a middleman, your vote still has an impact. By voting you are signaling to politicians your views on their performance and policies. This drives real change.</p>

        <h4>How to Vote?</h4>
        <p>There are many different types of elections. The primary ones are general, presidential, state, and municipal elections. Remember: Local elections are important too!</p>
        <p>Follow along with these 6 steps to cast your ballot:</p>
        <div class="subs">
          <p>1. Register To Vote: Registering to vote is locally managed, meaning each state has their own unique requirements. Provided that you are eligible to vote, you should be able to register online, in person, or through a paper form.</p>
          <p>2. Research Political Parties and Candidates: Informed voters are able to make knowledgeable decisions without being swayed by propaganda and biased media coverage.</p>
          <p>3. Know the Issues: Learn the policies at stake and the issues being debated in the upcoming election.</p>
          <p>4. Check State Rules and Regulations: Different states have different means of collecting your vote (mail ins or polling places), and different required identification. Make sure you are also aware of poll place timings.</p>
          <p>5. Cast Your Ballot: Finally cast your ballot by either going to your nearest polling place or through mailing in your vote.</p>
